That was the case for Carol and Julie when they first met one fateful night in 1961.</p><p>Carol told Kelly Ripa on the Let's Talk Off Camera podcast (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>) in April 2023, "First there was an agent and a manager that I knew, who knew Julie, and he also knew the executive producer of The Garry Moore Show. And they said, you know, you two girls have to meet."</p><p>Naturally, Carol and Julie's first meeting took place after the two women had both completed Broadway performances. Carol joked that their mutual contacts "didn't stand a chance" when all four of them met up for dinner one night.</p><p>"Julie and I never stopped talking," Carol said. "We just, it was like we've known each other forever. And, so that's since 1961 we've known each other."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Naturally, it would've been a crime not to have these two talented best friends create some sort of magic together, so Carol and Julie happily obliged the loving public with their first special together a year after their fateful first meeting.</p><p>Of course, the Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall special won an Emmy. Because of course. Do you expect anything less from these two icons?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Carol and Julie went on to reunite for the 1971 special Julie and Carol at Lincoln Center. Their 1989 special, Julie and Carol: Together Again, is available to watch on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p><p>The two besties have also been spotted on the red carpet supporting each other at various events honoring each other, including the March 2023 red carpet premiere of the NBC special Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love — a tribute to Carol's life and work in honor of her 90th birthday on April 26, 2023.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Julie, who appears in the NBC tribute to Carol, told People (via the same report), "From day one, we both seem to know and understand where each one of us is coming from ... Although we come from different countries, we recognized in each other things that were of mutual understanding."</p><p>Ever the relatable queen, Julie added that although she and Carol don't speak every single day, when they do it's "the kind of friendship that the minute you meet up again, it's exactly as it was. To know you've got a friend that special and loyal, and you don't need to be on, you don't need to be doing anything other than be yourself, it's a pleasure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zu8tmma6qnprBtXnJrqOinV2Wu6W%2BxLCqZp6inrKvsNKhoKk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./certain-spoken-word-performer-nyt-crossword-clue.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Certain spoken-word performer NYT Crossword Clue</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./take-a-look-at-the-grid-house-a-fascinating-piece-of-architecture-now-for-sale-outside-sao-paulo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Take A Look At The Grid House, A Fascinating Piece Of Architecture Now For Sale Outside Sao Paulo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ang%C3%A9lica-mar%C3%ADa-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Anglica Mara Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iyanla-vanzant-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-husband-kids-bio-wiki.html>Iyanla Vanzant Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-von-erich-is-kevin-von-erich-still-alive-how-many-von-erich-s-are-still-alive.html>Kevin Von Erich: Is Kevin Von Erich Still Alive?
