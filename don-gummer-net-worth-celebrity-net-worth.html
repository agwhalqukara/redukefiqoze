In October 2023 the couple announced that they had been separated for six years at that point.</p><p>As a sculptor, Don Gummer has earned praise for his work with table top and wall-mounted pieces as well as his large free-standing works. Many of his free-standing works were made of bronze, and in the '90s, he began adding materials such as stained glass and aluminum. Since his first solo showing in 1973, Don's works have been featured at more than two dozen solo shows at galleries and museums around the Midwest and East Coast. His work has also been exhibited in group shows. Art critic Irving Sandler stated that Gummer's works "give postmodern life to classic principles of abstract composition."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Don Gummer was born Donald James Gummer on December 12, 1946, in Louisville, Kentucky.
