He has hired a sober companion to stay with him and make sure he fights the temptation to drink and do drugs. He is <a href=#>said to be taking a healing journey to Arizona</a>, where he will be treated holistically using the traditional Native American method of a sweat box to rid the body of toxins. He will also undergo hypnosis and attend group therapy for addiction.</p><p>Yoga is also on Owen Wilson’s itinerary. Jennifer Aniston is a strong proponent of the practice, and has spoken candidly about how it helped her to work through her negative emotions following the breakup of her marriage.</p><p>Aniston will be working with Wilson on the upcoming film Marley and Me, and is said to have sent him some books and to have encouraged him to pursue meditation and yoga as part of his path to healing. It’s possible she influenced him to take the trip to Arizona and to embrace holistic practices as part of his recovery:</p><p>Owen Wilson has a concerned Friend rooting for his recovery – Jennifer Aniston! The two, who are slated to work on the film adaptation of the best seller Marley & Me, have been speaking regularly by telephone and e-mail since Owen was taken to an L.A. hospital after a failed suicide attempt on Aug. 26.</p><p>Jen has sent him some of her favorite books, including The Power of Now, and she’s “been encouraging Owen to practice breathing techniques, yoga and meditation,” says a source close to the actress. “Owen has come to rely on Jen’s phone calls.” They’ve connected, adds the source, because “both are wounded souls.”</p><p>[From Star Magazine, print edition, October 15, 2007]</p><p>If you read between the lines Star is suggesting a love match there, but since Aniston and Wilson haven’t been seen out together and their source probably just knows that she sent him books, there’s not enough to go on to declare a relationship, even by tabloid standards.</p><p>Jennifer Aniston is portrayed as a sad sap who can’t get a man while Owen Wilson has the stigma of a failed suicide attempt and crippling depression. It’s a match made in tabloid heaven, and it would certainly sell copies on the week they’re declared an item. If they’re ever foolish enough to be seen in each other’s presence when they’re not on set making that movie it’s sure to make the covers of the glossies. I don’t mean to sound too harsh, and I don’t view either of them that way, but celebrities become caricatures for our entertainment and the paper cut outs of these two would make a nice couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmb21ibXyrsc2noJ%2BdopSur7XSraanl6KarqS0xKyWqK2klMGwq86wnKeXp565tLvNmKCnl5iewKC%2BxJymr52irnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rh-executive-gary-friedman-buys-beverly-hills-promontory-for-37-million.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RH Executive Gary Friedman Buys Beverly Hills &amp;quot;Promontory&amp;quot; For $37 Million</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-koechner-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Koechner Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ang%C3%A9lica-mar%C3%ADa-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Anglica Mara Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iyanla-vanzant-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-husband-kids-bio-wiki.html>Iyanla Vanzant Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-von-erich-is-kevin-von-erich-still-alive-how-many-von-erich-s-are-still-alive.html>Kevin Von Erich: Is Kevin Von Erich Still Alive?
