News</a>. “And I’m reminded of how much Tracy has inspired and encouraged me to celebrate every version of my body over the years and to continue to elevate as my own life and needs changed.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">She continued: “I met Tracy right after I had my twins. I called her at a time when I was feeling insecure and uncertain, <a href=#>wondering if I would ever get back</a> to how I was before — as most new moms do after giving birth.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Lopez, who shares Max and Emme, now 15, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a>, noted that Anderson helped her “embrace the new me” and “realized that I could be stronger than I ever had before.”<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Prior to Lopez’s heartfelt dedication on Sunday, Anderson — who is known for her A-list client list which includes<a href=#><strong> Jennifer Aniston</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> — shared why she thinks celebrities have resonated so deeply with her fitness routines, which include breaking down the “toxic part of our culture” that fuels insecurities.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It’s not about getting to a certain size or having perfect skin or shiny hair or a certain bra size or butt shape,”&nbsp;she&nbsp;told E!. “It’s about something so much deeper than that. It’s <a href=#>something that lights up behind the eyes and the soul</a>—and not all these superficial things.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Anderson’s workouts have seemingly helped Lopez regain her confidence postpartum. The singer<a href=#> celebrated her 54th birthday in July</a> by dancing on tables with friends and showing off her toned physique as she soaked up the sun on the water. “Birthday mood…all month!!” <a href=#>she wrote via Instagram</a> alongside a series of images from the celebration.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Lopez has likely also been re-energized by her romance with <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, whom she previously dated in the early 2000s. After finalizing her divorce from Anthony, 55, in 2014, Lopez moved on with <strong><a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>.</strong> The pair were together for four years before calling off their engagement in April 2021. Later that year, she rekindled her romance with Affleck, 51, and the couple tied the knot in July 2022.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The couple have since taken to social media to gush over their love for one another — and Lopez has often praised Affleck<a href=#> for being an “amazing” husband</a> and stepfather to her children. (Affleck shares daughters Violet, 17, and Seraphina, 14, and son Samuel, 11, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>.)<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It brings tears to my eyes, <a href=#>he is honestly the best dad I have ever seen</a>,” Lopez said of the Argo director during a May 2023 appearance on<i class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</i><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The View.&nbsp;</span>“He’s such a brilliant guy anyway, and you can tell that when he had his kids&nbsp;he must have read every book and everything that you could possibly learn about children, and he applies it. He’s present, and that’s all you can ask, for a present, loving dad who shows up every single day, and that’s who he is.”<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WajqKiVr3qnscutZKKmo5qwtr7EZpibp6Wpeqmx0WaZqJypYq6nwMSrZKChpp67qHnBoqmtoF2pvG7A1qKlrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stem-cell-therapy-after-another-hair-debacle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stem cell therapy after another hair debacle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./darrell-waltrip-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Darrell Waltrip Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ang%C3%A9lica-mar%C3%ADa-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Anglica Mara Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iyanla-vanzant-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-husband-kids-bio-wiki.html>Iyanla Vanzant Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-von-erich-is-kevin-von-erich-still-alive-how-many-von-erich-s-are-still-alive.html>Kevin Von Erich: Is Kevin Von Erich Still Alive?
