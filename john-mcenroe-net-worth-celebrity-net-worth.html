When McEnroe was a baby, the family moved to Newburgh, New York's Stewart Air Force Base, and they relocated to Flushing, Queens, in 1961 and Douglaston in 1963. John's father later left the Air Force and worked as an advertising agent during the day and studied at Fordham Law School at night. John's brothers Mark and Patrick were born in 1964 and 1966, respectively, and Patrick also grew up to be professional tennis player.
