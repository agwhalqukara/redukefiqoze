They’ve lived together as a couple and were excited to share the moments with close friends,” a source told Us Weekly after the nuptials. “She was thrilled and a beautiful bride.”</p><p>The couple went on to <a href=#>welcome daughter Georgia</a> in 2014 and <a href=#>daughter Gianna</a> in 2018.</p><p>“Georgia is obsessed with her. She’s always calling her ‘my baby,” Thompson told Us in 2018 after his youngest arrived. “She’s like, ‘My baby. Good morning my little baby.’ She’s always wanting to hold her.”</p><p>The Saturday Night Live star went on to gush about his “big happy family” with Evangeline.</p><p>“Georgia’s busy right now. She’s got school. So we miss her throughout the day, but when she gets home, we go to dinner or something,” he quipped to Us of their family dynamic at the time. “That’s always nice.”</p><p>Three years later, the Kenan actor said being a father was “everything” to him.</p><p>“I stopped my bachelor life and just was spending a lot of time by myself because they say, when you stop looking, you will find it,” he recalled to <a href=#>Fatherly</a> in 2021. “And then I met my wife and we had the same ideology. We wanted to get married and we wanted to start a family and keep a family. It’s my daily focus — is everybody taken care of? And then my other focus is, how am I taking care of everybody. That’s what probably drives me to work like such a maniac. I want to personally satisfy the need to provide like that.”</p><p>One year later, Us confirmed <a href=#>Thompson and Evangeline had split</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Kenan and Christina are completely amicable,” the insider told Us in April 2022. “They remain close as coparents and have remained very close throughout the separation.”</p><p>Scroll through for a timeline of Thompson and Evangeline’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa6wKdkraCfor20u81mrqKelWKwqb7IrKuippFisretzaCcpaGemsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-laura-slade-wiggins-net-worth-2024-financial-insights.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Laura Slade Wiggins Net Worth 2024: Financial Insights</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-stylist-jeremiah-ogbodo-popularly-known-as-swankyjerry-barack-obama-ngozi-okonjoiweala.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity stylist Jeremiah Ogbodo popularly known as Swankyjerry, Barack Obama, Ngozi Okonjoiweala,</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ang%C3%A9lica-mar%C3%ADa-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Anglica Mara Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iyanla-vanzant-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-husband-kids-bio-wiki.html>Iyanla Vanzant Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-von-erich-is-kevin-von-erich-still-alive-how-many-von-erich-s-are-still-alive.html>Kevin Von Erich: Is Kevin Von Erich Still Alive?
