In fact, some studies have suggested that shorter women may have an edge over taller women in leadership positions, as they are perceived as more competent, confident, and assertive5<a href=# rel=noopener>6</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Does Lauren Boebert Compare to Other Politicians?</strong></h2><p>Lauren Boebert’s height of 5 feet 4 inches makes her one of the shortest members of Congress, but not the shortest. According to a report by The Washington Post, the average height of members of the 117th Congress is 5 feet 9 inches for men and 5 feet 6 inches for women<a href=# rel=noopener>7</a> The shortest member of Congress is Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, who stands at 5 feet 1 inch or 1.55 meters.
