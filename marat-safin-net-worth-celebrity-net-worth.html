I have comrades who say, 'You are already 40 years old. It's time to start a family and children.' And I understand that everyone has their own time for this. I am ready, in principle, to live without children, a girl or a wife. If I meet a person who will be an interesting partner to me, then yes. But I don't want to do this for the sake of a tick." In 2008, Marat told "USA Today," "I'm Russian, but I'm 100% Muslim. All the Muslim people are passionate, stubborn. We have hot blood." During an interview with Alexander Golovin of Sports.Ru a decade later, Safin said that though he believes something was responsible for the creation of the world, he doesn't believe in a personal God.</p><h2 id=award-nominations><strong>Award Nominations</strong></h2><p>Safin was nominated for ESPY Awards for Best Tennis Player â€“ Male in 2001 and 2005.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWkmruvtdJopJqqkal6tK3FoqVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./open-edit-knit-dress-is-putting-our-other-sweater-dresses-to-shame.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Open Edit Knit Dress Is Putting Our Other Sweater Dresses To Shame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./like-bright-highlighter-colors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Like bright highlighter colors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ang%C3%A9lica-mar%C3%ADa-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Anglica Mara Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iyanla-vanzant-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-husband-kids-bio-wiki.html>Iyanla Vanzant Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-von-erich-is-kevin-von-erich-still-alive-how-many-von-erich-s-are-still-alive.html>Kevin Von Erich: Is Kevin Von Erich Still Alive?
