His records have had a sale of over 20 million records worldwide. Apart from a passionate musician, he is also an enthusiastic photographer.</p><p>Maybe you know about Moby very well But do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Moby’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Richard Melville Hall was born on the 11th of September, 1965 in Harlem (near NYC). His mother, Elizabeth McBride was a medical secretary and his father, James Frederick Hall, was a chemistry professor.</p><p>Moby’s parents gave him his middle name due to the supposition that his great-great-great grand uncle was Herman Melville, the author of the famous novel ‘Moby Dick’. Richard’s father died when he was only two, and his responsibility was left singlehandedly on his mother, who raised him in Darien, Connecticut.</p><p>When he was young, he got involved in drugs and at the age of 19, due to the usage of LSD, started experiencing panic attacks. Although he no longer suffers from such attacks as much as before, still there are times when due to certain triggering aspects, like high caffeine and stress, he gets agitated and panicky.</p><p>He was also a heavy drinker for quite a long time. In April 2014 however, he took up sobriety. Moby always had a knack for photography and became an active photographer right from the time he was 10. In November 2015, he opened up a Vegan restaurant in Los Angeles named ‘Little Pine’, which he manages personally. He is a vegan and supports animal rights. Moby currently lives in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 11 September 1965, Moby is 58 years old as of today’s date 22nd July 2024. His height is 1.71 m tall, and weight is 63 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Moby has released <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">his music</a> under other pseudonyms as well, such as “Voodoo Child”, “Barracuda”, “Schaumgummi”, “Brainstorm” etc. His first single, ‘Time’s up’, which was for commercial purposes, was a flop. His first single after he took up the name Moby was ‘Mobility’, and that proved to be his first-ever breakthrough.</p><p>In October 1991, it reached the UK top 10 and gave him a chance to appear on ‘Top of the Pops’. He released an album under his name in 1992. In 1992-93, he released many singles, like ‘Next is the E’, ‘Thousand’, and ‘Voodoo Child’. He signed with Mute Records in 1993 to release an EP named ‘Move’, which resulted in his second appearance at ‘Top of the Pops’.</p><p>His first album under Mute Records was released in 1995 titled ‘Everything Is Wrong’, which was critically acclaimed. He followed it up in 1996 with a double album named ‘Everything is Wrong- Mixed and Remixed’. In the same year, he also decided to release an album in the punk rock genre titled ‘Animal Rights’. ‘Come on Baby’, a single from ‘Animal Rights’ became his third-time performance at ‘Top of the Pops’.</p><p>He compiled his music, which had been used in movies and released a collection themed ‘I Like to Score’ in 1997. The collection contained an updated version of ‘The James Bond Theme’ from the movie ‘Tomorrow Never Dies’ and also a version of ‘New Dawn Fades’. Two years later, in 1999, Moby released an album named ‘Play’, which received a mediocre response at first, but then eventually sold out 10 million records internationally.</p><p>Moby released another album in 2005 named ‘Hotel’, which included the two biggest European hit singles, ‘Lift Me’ and ‘Slipping Away’. In between this album and the next, Moby started a rock band in 2007 with his friends Daron Murphy, Laura Dawn and Aaron A. Brooks named ‘The Little Death’.</p><p>His next album was released on June 2009 and was titled ‘Wait for Me’. Moby announced his next album on 15th February 2011. ‘Destroyed’ was then released on 16th May 2011. He also released a photography book under the same name for the promotion of the album. The singer then went on to release, ‘Destroyed Remix’, a limited edition CD collection, on the 30th of April, 2012. His album titled ‘Innocents’ was revealed in 2013. He then went dormant for three years.</p><p>In September 2016, it was announced that a new album named ‘These Systems are Falling’ would be released by Moby. The album came out on 14th October 2016 under the label ‘Moby and the Void Pacific Choir’. The first single of the album was ‘Are you Lost in the World Like Me’. Moby announced his latest album on 11th December 2017 named ‘Everything was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt’, which was a trip inspiration and was scheduled to release on the 2nd of March, 2018.</p><p>In May of 2016, the famous singer and songwriter also wrote and published an autobiography named ‘Porcelain: A Memoir’. Apart from music, Moby also works with various organisations like ‘MoveOn.org’, ‘The Humane Society’, ‘Farm Sanctuary’, etc. He also started a website named ‘MobyGratis.com’ in 2007, which was designed to help and benefit anyone in need of free music for their cinematic project or otherwise. Interestingly, Moby is also a board member of the ‘Institute for Music and Neurological Functions’ ‘IMNF’.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>• Won the VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards- Visionary Video (2000).<br>• Won MTV EMA- Best Video for ‘Natural Blues’ (2000).<br>• Won NME Awards- Best Live Act (2001).<br>• Won MTV VMA- Best Male Video for ‘South Side’ (2001).<br>• Won NRJ Music <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Awards</a> – International Male Artist of the Year’ (2001).<br>• Won IFPI Platinum Europe Awards-Album Title(2001 and 2002)<br>• Won BMI Pop Songs Awards for ‘South Side’ (2002).<br>• Won Billboard Music Awards- Electronic Album of the Year as well as Electronic Artist of the Year (2002)<br>• Won Q Awards- Best Producer (2002).<br>• Won BMI Film and TV Awards- Certificate of Achievement (2002).<br>• Won MTV EMA- Web Awards (2002).<br>• Won MTV VMA- Best Cinematography for ‘We are all made of stars’ (2002).<br>• Won IFPI Platinum Europe Awards- Album Title for ‘18’ (2003).<br>• Won MVPA Awards- Best Electronic Video as well as Best Directional Debut for ‘In this World’ (2003).<br>• Won Veggie Awards- Person of the Year (2015).<br>• Won Webby Awards- Animation (2017).<br>• Was nominated for Grammy Awards in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2009.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Moby in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Moby-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The estimated net worth of Moby is a considerable $45 million, thanks to his enormously successful music career.</p><p>Moby has worked tremendously hard and consistently to achieve all that he has today.
