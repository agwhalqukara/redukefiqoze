As an actor, he was incredibly gifted, adventurous, and courageous.”</p><p>In a four-decade playing career, Liotta established himself as one of Hollywood’s most dependable tough-guy actors, adept at portraying cops and criminals in films such as “Something Wild,” “Cop Land,” and “Killing Them Softly.”</p><h2>Ray Liotta Personal Life</h2><p>After meeting at a baseball game where her ex-husband Mark Grace was playing for the Chicago Cubs, Liotta engaged actress and producer Michelle Grace in February 1997. Before getting a divorce in 2004, the couple was blessed with a daughter named Karsen.</p><p>During an appearance on Jay Leno’s Garage, Ray Liotta said that the daughters of Frank Sinatra, Nancy and Tina Sinatra, had previously sent a horse’s head to Liotta in the mail. The joke was told as a reaction to Liotta turning down the opportunity to play their late father in a miniseries that they were working on, only to have Liotta reprise the role in The Rat Pack, a television film that aired on HBO in 1998.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Randy Weaver Cause Of Death: American Survivalist Randy Weaver Dies At 74, Daughter Confirms</a></li><li><a href=#>Did Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Break Up?
