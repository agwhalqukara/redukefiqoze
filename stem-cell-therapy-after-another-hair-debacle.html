The follicular fiasco had occurred earlier this month after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 39-year-old mother of five</a> attempted to conceal some gray hairs with dye but ended up burning her scalp and losing her luscious locks, a side effect <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she documented in a TikTok</a> that racked up 2.9 million views.</p><p>Brown’s representative Gina Rodriguez claimed that chemicals used to remove the glue from her hair this year interacted with the dye, causing her mane to melt.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Louisiana’s Tessica Brown, who went viral last year for using Gorilla Glue as hairspray, has undergone stem cell therapy to revive her hair after a disastrous dye job caused it to fall out.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tessica Brown underwent stem cell therapy at the La Fue Hair Clinic in Pasadena, Calif. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Dr. G.

He added that the therapy’s growth-accelerating benefits should take effect in around six to nine months.</p><p>“Nothing that’s gonna happen overnight, but the shedding should stop real soon,” a hopeful Brown told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hair expert Jacques Abrahamian oversaw the procedure. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">It took two sets of hands to perform the work on Brown’s scalp. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A closeup of the injection site shows where Brown’s hair had been thinned the most. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">The treatment of this fountain of youth could cost around $6,000. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><p>The only downside is that “Gorilla Glue girl” will have to wait several months before dyeing her hair again. When the time comes, Abrahamian recommends an “organic hair dye” without paraphenylenediamine, a chemical widely used in conventional hair dyes, which he said caused Brown’s initial allergic reaction.</p><p>Brown, for one, is not going to roll the dye when it comes to hair colorants. “I think I’m just going to stick with that,” she said. “At this point, I’m just scared.”</p><p>It’s been a long road for Brown, who spawned nationwide facepalms after styling her with Gorilla Glue and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing her hardship</a> on social media in February. She had resorted to the ill-advised sculpting method as she was late for a date and didn’t have any traditional hair adhesive.</p><p>Go figure: The Gorilla Glue wouldn’t come out of her hair no matter how much she washed it and she feared that she was going to lose it entirely.
