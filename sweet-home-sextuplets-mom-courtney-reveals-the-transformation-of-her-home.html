Sometimes, all of those kids made fans feel exhausted. But there’s no denying their love for the kids and their community. Clean and free of drama, the show was a breath of fresh air. This week, Courtney took fans back down memory lane to when they first started refurbishing their lovely ranch-style home.</p><h3>Sweet Home Sextuplets Family Lived In A Trailer</h3><p>You might recall that at one stage, the whole family lived in a trailer. That came when Eric started refurbishing their home. Actually, the kids were being potty trained at the time, which seemed like a really bad idea. Especially as their mom tried to do them all at the same time. Anyway, their home eventually became habitable after the lockdown and since then, <a href=#>many happy scenes arrived</a>.</p><p>Sweet Home Sextuplets fans feared that the show might not be renewed. And sure enough, it didn’t return. The news came from TLC and from the family. It turned out that they felt it was not fair on Eric who worked so very hard. Bear in mind, he coached the older kids, Saylor and the twins at baseball and basketball. Plus he ran their landscaping business. Furthermore, he raised livestock. Additionally, he rebuilt their home and transformed it into a real beauty. No wonder he always looked exhausted. So, the family <a href=#>decided to walk away from reality TV</a>.</p><h3>Sweet Home Sextuplets: Courtney Reveals the Changes To Their Home</h3><p>Whilst TLC fans saw the home being converted from the original dreary brown to gleaming white, they never saw the finished product. Actually, according to Courtney, it still isn’t finished. This weekend, she shared a lot of photos that showed the transformation. In her caption, she said, “Coming soon another phase!!🙈<br>Maybe one more phase will be the last phase!!😳”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Courney-Waldrop.jpg><p>The Sweet Home Sextuplets’ mom talked about how they remodeled for “four years.” Wow, that seems like a long time, and it still needs more expansion. She added, “Always fun to show a little [snippet] of what our house used to look like…compared to three house remodel phases later😝.” Certainly, it looks impressive, and it’s nice to see that all their hard work is paying off.</p><h3>TLC Fans React</h3><p>In the comments of the post, Sweet Home Sextuplets fans let Courtney know that they loved the changes to the family home. One of them wrote, “I remember when you guys lived in a trailer house to remodel!”</p><p>Another impressed follower said, “You & Eric are amazing!!! I don’t know how y’all do all that you do!!! ❤️”</p><p>One fan nutshelled th development fifth home. They wrote, “But it’s not a house. It’s your home. It’s clear that’s what you’ve been building …in a community you love and are involved in. What a special gift to give your kids.”</p><p>Can you recall the old home? Are you amazed at how much they expanded?
