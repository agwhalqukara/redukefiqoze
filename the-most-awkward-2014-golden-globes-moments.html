The 69 year old actress won a Golden Globes for her work in Dancing on the Edge, and her speech was one of the most memorable moments of the evening. It took her forever to start talking and when she did she just stopped again. She even rang out an expletive. Good for her on the award but her moment was very odd.</p><p>Photo via&nbsp;Kevin Winter/Getty</p><p><strong>Everything P Diddy Did – But Hugging Bono was Awkward</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="The Weinstein Company & Netflix's 2014 Golden Globes After Party Presented By Bombardier, FIJI Water, Lexus, Laura Mercier, Marie Claire And Yucaipa Films - Inside" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/462287573.jpg width=594 height=441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>It’s clearly evident that Mr. Diddy was not himself last night and he was hemming and hawing the entire time he was on stage.&nbsp; But perhaps nothing was more awkward than when he tried to hug Bono after he accepted his best Song award.&nbsp; Bono completely backed off when Diddy advanced.&nbsp; Here’s the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vine</a> to prove it.</p><p>Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for The Weinstein Company</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lawrence Creeping up on Taylor Swift</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="Moet & Chandon At The 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards - Inside" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/462248381.jpg width=594 height=392 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Granted this was awkward, it was still really really funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gif</a> of that moment.</p><p>Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Moet & Chandon</p><p><strong>Fire Sprinkler Malfunction at the Beverly Hills Hotel</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt=sprinkler src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sprinkler.jpg width=602 height=382 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>This is the stuff they don’t show you on television.&nbsp; And every year a lot of these things actually happen where the entire show is put in jeopardy.&nbsp; Viewers didn’t know but luckily a Vine was put up showing how a fire sprinkler malfunctions at the Beverly Hills Hotel.&nbsp; This malfunction could have completely soaked the red carpet making for an evening full of awkward trips and falling.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean sure they’d have gotten another red carpet but it was a big mistake.&nbsp; Here’s the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vine</a>.</p><p><strong>Matt McConaughey out McConaughey’ed Everyone</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="HBO's Post 2014 Golden Globe Awards Party - Inside" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/462380603.jpg width=594 height=396 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The emergence of Matthew McConaughey as a heavyweight acting talent has been gathering steam over the past two years — but with a Best Actor win at the Golden Globes for “Dallas Buyers Club,”&nbsp; the actor has officially transformed into an Oscars frontrunner.&nbsp; And his speech last night didn’t disappoint.&nbsp; He had a&nbsp; Dazed and Confused reference, rhythmic rhyming, awesome swaying, genuine excitement, and an awesome signoff. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here it is</a></p><p>Photo by Mike Windle/Getty Images</p><p>We’ve also got some solid pictures of the event as well…..</p><p>Images via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Splashnews</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYsKOnlr%2BleZFpaG1ll6S5pbHNZp6lp5KawG65zqacp6yjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-yoki-sturrup-wiki-husband-biography-net-worth-kids-parents-nationality-height-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Yoki Sturrup?
