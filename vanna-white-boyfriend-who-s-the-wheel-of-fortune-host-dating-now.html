In September 2023, news broke that <a href=# rel=noopener>White had renewed her contract</a> with Wheel Fortune for two years through the 2025 to 2026 season. The news came three months after Sajak announced he was retiring as Wheel of Fortune‘s host after more than 40 years in the role. “Well, the time has come. I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last,” Sajak said at the time. “It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months. Many thanks to you all. (If nothing else, it’ll keep the clickbait sites busy!)”</p><p>Ryan Seacrest was announced as Sajak’s replacement, as rumors swirled about <a href=# rel=noopener>White’s dissatisfaction with her salary</a> on the series. “It was because people just have rumors,” White told People in October 2023. “Everything is so blown out of proportion, not just with my stuff, with everybody’s stuff.” She continued, “I’m not going to do anything I don’t want to do or that I don’t believe in. My mother taught me that at a young age and I’m sticking to my guns.”</p><p>One person by White’s side the whole time has been her partner, John Donaldson.

However, she has been married once before. White was married to her ex-husband, restaurant owner George Santo Pietro, from 1990 to 2002. White and Santo Pietro share two children together: a daughter named Gigi, who was born in 1997, and a son named Nikko, who was born in 1994.</p><p>While White doesn’t have a current husband, she has been with her boyfriend, John Donaldson, for more than 12 years. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in October 2023, White explained why she hasn’t married Donaldson yet and maybe never will. “I mean, we’ve been together 12 years, and I feel like we are married,” she said. “Do we have to get married? No, because we feel comfortable in our relationship. You know what I mean? I know that he’s the one. He knows I’m the one.”</p><p>White also revealed that she and Donaldson haven’t discussed the topic of marriage. “We don’t really talk about it, but you never know. I mean, I guess we could, but in my eyes and his eyes, we are married,” White said, describing Donaldson as the “male version” of her. She continued, “We really are very similar. We get along so well. He’s easy. He’s easy, and he lets me be me, and I let him be him.”</p><p>White also revealed her secret to her and Donald’s long-lasting relationship. “Don’t be in a relationship because you’re lonely, because if you’re not happy, you’re still lonely,” she said. “Just be who you are, and don’t let anybody change who you are. It’s nice when they make you feel good about yourself, or they love who you are as a person and don’t want to change you. It’s got to be easy.”</p><h2>How did Vanna White meet her boyfriend John Donaldson?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vanna-White-John-Donaldson.jpg alt="Vanna White - Wheel of Fortune" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Vanna White and her boyfriend, John Donaldson, met in 2012 when a friend brought him to a barbecue she was hosting. Their meeting came a decade after White split from her ex-husband, George Santo Pietro, in 2002. “I remember looking at him and thinking, ‘He’s really cute,'” White told People in 2019. “We ended up talking for a long time that night.” She continued, “It just works. He lets me be me, I let him be him. There is no drama.”</p><h2>Who is Vanna White’s boyfriend John Donaldson?</h2><p>Vanna White’s boyfriend John Donaldson was born and raised in Santa Monica, California. He is the owner of the construction company, JDC Construction + Development Group, in California. He is also the president and building developer of the company, which was named John R. Donaldson, Inc until it changed names in July 2014.</p><p>“JDC prides itself on its tradesman roots and the insight which years of hands on experience provides to property owners, architects and engineers in developing realistic plans for revitalization projects, as well as finding appropriate solutions to renovation challenges,” the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">company’s website</a> reads.</p><p>The company, which launched in 1987 and is based in Southern California, specializes in “the restoration and rehabilitation of Multifamily properties and now the development of new ground up multifamily projects.” According to the company’s website, Donaldson’s construction career started at a young age when he accepted a job as a laborer in the San Fernando Valley.
